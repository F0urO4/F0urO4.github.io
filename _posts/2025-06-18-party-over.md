## TL;DR  
I‚Äôm realizing drinking is holding me back. Weekends get wasted, literally. I‚Äôm not an alcoholic, but I keep sabotaging myself. I imagine a better life without it, and I‚Äôm starting to think the party‚Äôs over. This is me facing that.

## the party is over  
This is me realizing that I‚Äôve been looking for any excuse to not get my shit done.  

You know that cringe kids are saying nowadays, "lock in." What do you mean by lock in? Lock in to what? Watching more TikToks! I joke, of course.

I've come to a realization of always wanting a reason to not do my work on the weekends, and for me the best way to procrastinate a lot is drink while I work and get sidetracked to do something else while I keep drinking.

I've never been a raging alcoholic or like a daily drinker, but I do like to indulge.

**_I think the party is over, and I'm very sad to think of it being over._** I got so much left in me to keep it going, but week after week I just keep hating myself for not getting more done.  

**_It's one or the other._** Either you can be successful in the future, or you can drink now‚Äîand success is probably not going to come after because you're not doing anything productive!

## the weekend  
This is how my weekends usually go, and how one bad choice turns into a chain reaction that kills my progress.  

During the week I tend to do the work required for my business while trying to maintain a job. Then the weekend comes and I throw my hands in the air like on Monday I'm not going to be regretting what I did with my time.

You make one bad decision and the whole weekend is fucked! Why?  

Drink on Friday after work, then you wake late on Saturday. By the time you finish breakfast, there are more plans.

You go out on Saturday or do something that requires you to keep drinking, and then you wake up Sunday even later than you did on Saturday. Sunday comes and it is no different‚Äîmaybe some evening drinks, a movie, and then boom, your weekend is over.  

**_Nothing productive happened. No new milestones were even touched._**

I always imagine how my life would be if I worked hard on Fridays, Saturdays and used Sundays to progress in my family life‚Äîlike my house, go out and do something nice with my wife, run errands, and maybe see something at night or talk, but without alcohol.

wake up early, push the boulder even further and maybe do something toward the evening‚Äîbut without drinking and not too late, like around 10pm be sleeping already.

That would be perfect.  
**_But that would mean that the party is over._**

## I'm kinda done drinking  
This is me questioning what alcohol has actually added to my life.  

Think about it. How many alcohol-infused conversations have you had in your life that were completely game-changers?

Like you were able to create these incredible new patterns in your mind that are going to take you to higher highs?

Or when was the last time that you were able to say, "Wow, I never thought this conversation was going to change my life due to us drinking"?  

Maybe a couple.  
I can count them with one hand ‚úã.  

Now, how many times has alcohol put you in bad situations where you likely never would have put yourself if it wasn't for alcohol?  
I've run out of fingers and toes.

**_I'm not going to say that it's a culture thing, because a lot of my people are obese as well, and I don't like eating bad food._**  

And it kind of clicked:  
**_if I don't like eating bad because it affects my body, then why am I drinking?_**  

If I want to keep working hard for my future and I see that alcohol is an obstacle, then why am I drinking?

## I'm missing  
This is me being brutally honest with myself.  

"I don't miss"‚ÄîI wish I could say that with a straight face, because I miss every time in every sector of my life.  

Maybe I'm being too hard on myself, but fuck it!

**_I don't expect anyone to think highly of me except for myself._**

And I don't want to be the guy who is always complaining when I'm not doing anything to prevent it.

I just want to be successful, and I've been waiting too long‚Äîand I'm going to put emphasis on the "wait."  

**_What are you waiting for?_**

Of course I'm talking about myself, you can do what ever the fuck you want üòù
