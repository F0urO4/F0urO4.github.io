June. Isn’t June supposed to be hot? It’s raining over here in Tijuana, and I’m feeling melancholic thinking about the past. Yesterday, I made some money moves on the internet and was able to create $1,283 of unrealized profit. Unrealized means that, hypothetically, when the items I listed sell, I will make that amount—or less. There’s no extra in unrealized profit.

My store, which I manage, sells on average 80% of its stock in 90 days. And the fact that I can tell you how many items I sell per day, how much I make per item, and that I’m able to see—with metaphorical binoculars—where I’ll be in a year growing my business is kinda crazy.

This didn’t happen overnight, and I am not at all rich, wealthy, or sitting on a lot of money in the bank. But I do know that if I keep progressing, I’ll need to start thinking about a strategy to keep more inventory and find more inventory.

I do arbitrage: you find items for cheap and sell them at market value. You only make money on the spread. You can build a brand, market it, and create sales the traditional way—by inventing something that exists or doesn’t exist. But why do all that work when there are brands that have already done the heavy lifting? All you have to do is find them at a reasonable cost, sell them at a reasonable price, and keep the money that’s left over.

You can build million-dollar businesses in this gray area. It’s very hard and requires a lot of inventory and overhead. But my vision is simply to create $100,000 in profit per year and see if I want to stay there or keep progressing.

Why?
Because with $100,000, you can live below your means, save money, and have enough to keep redeploying your initial investment back into the business. When that day comes, I can start thinking about other methods of generating income—without having to run the business myself.
